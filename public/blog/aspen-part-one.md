# Aspen Series

Every developer/designer has been here a number of times. Some more than others. Me, surely more than everyone . Where is this? Creating another portfolio site. This place is too stressful.

Coming up with a site format that display many aspect of your career and personality is very daunting. Sometimes you start out very ambitious (after being inspired by others); animation + colors + responsiveness coolness. Sometimes, dammit, you want it simple. One column, not too many colors. Fast! And label it as "Web Standards Compliant".

It's hard.

I have kept my previous website for about a year now. It was built with Docusaurus so I didn't have to worry much about design. Only thing I had to worry about was the homepage, which I believe I killed it â€” in a simple way. I also did some few style overrides on the content pages and that was it.

The following is a video demo of my old site.

## Content? Happy?

But deep down I didn't like Docusaurus entirely. I found myself [swizzling components](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling) so I could override styles or hide some elements, etc. Now this was risky as Docusaurus could publish updates in future which will break things. I don't like uncertain futures like this.

I like control.
