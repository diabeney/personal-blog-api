Have you ever wondered why your hot food eventually becomes cold ðŸ˜…? why water transforms into vapour at 100 degrees Celsius with such ease at atmospheric pressure? or why certain conditions seem to trigger chemical reactions?

In this blog post, we embark on an interesting journey to understand the fundamental principles underlying these phenomena. While I'll touch on some technical terms, my aim is to make these concepts accessible to everyone by minimizing the use of mathematical equations. Remember this is a deep dive, so it's going to be lengthy.

    ## What's the problem?

The First Law of Thermodynamics, while valuable for understanding energy conservation, doesn't address the practical constraints of energy conversionsâ€”whether it's **physically possible** to convert energy from one form to another under specific conditions.

In order to understand the practical meaning of entropy, we need to define 'work'.

## Work

The concept of work is frequently used in the fields of Science and Engineering, but what precisely does it entail? To put it simply, work is determined by multiplying the distance a body travels by the force that acts against its motion. In essence, when moving a body from point A to point B, energy is expended to overcome any opposing forces. If there are no opposing forces, no work is performed.

When we focus solely on the energy within the body, we can deduce that energy is consistently transferred from one point to another in the form of work. However, for an object to move from one place to another, there must be a force driving it. There are various driving forces, but when the driving force is a temperature gradient or difference, we refer to the work done as **heat.**

Up to this point, I've employed the term 'point' to represent a location. We can view these points as representing a system and its surroundings. Energy can be transferred from a system (point A) to its surroundings (point B) or in the opposite direction.

# Entropy

Theoretically, there is a maximum amount of work that can be done in every process. This maximum can be achieved if the process is done on a reversible path. A process is said to be reversible if
