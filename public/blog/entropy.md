Have you ever wondered why your hot food eventually becomes cold ðŸ˜…? why water transforms into vapour at 100 degrees Celsius with such ease at atmospheric pressure? or why certain conditions seem to trigger chemical reactions?

In this blog post, we embark on an interesting journey to understand the fundamental principles underlying these phenomena. While I'll touch on some technical terms, my aim is to make these concepts accessible to everyone by minimizing the use of mathematical equations. Remember this is a deep dive, so it's going to be lengthy.

    ## What's the problem?

The First Law of Thermodynamics, while valuable for understanding energy conservation, doesn't address the practical constraints of energy conversionsâ€”whether it's **physically achievable** to convert energy from one form to another under specific conditions.

Designers do not have infinite freedom to specify operating conditions. There exists a theoretical maximum or minimum limit on energy transfer in any process, given certain conditions. The Second Law of Thermodynamics and the concept of entropy help determine these 'maximum' or 'minimum' values.

## Entropy

Once your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.

<div className = 'info'  >
Entropy can be defined in different ways. For now we are going to stick to the definition in terms of 'lost' work.

## Synchronize a file

If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the **Synchronize now** button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The **Synchronize now** button is disabled if you have no file to synchronize.

## Manage file synchronization

Since one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking **File synchronization** in the **Synchronize** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized locations that are linked to your file.
